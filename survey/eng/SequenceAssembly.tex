\section{Before Everything}
I would like to first explain the motivation of this article at the beginning. The theme of this article is about sequence assembly which is a computer aided process for constructing gene sequence. It is actually belonging to the scope of bioinformatics. As a pure computer science undergraduate student, I have started researching in this field since the summer in 2010. After reading lots of papers, discussing with biology researchers from China as well as foreign ones, trying kinds of bioinformatic tools, I approached nothing new but valuable experiences of it. In this article, I will answer the questions of "what is gene sequencing", "what is sequence assembly and its challenge", "how to assembly sequence", "how to evaluate sequence assembly softwares" and my own contribution to sequence assembly in a computer science researcher's perspective. I'am not going to tell the deep details but giving initiations about what to do and how to do about sequence assembly. Moreover, I will provide valuable references of related papers and materials to help you get a full view of sequence assembly.
